ItemSink causes items to always sink when in souce block water.

Items will still be pushed up from bubble columns.

By opening the ItemSinkGUI inventory (/isg) and clicking the item named "Whitelist", it will turn into a blacklist and all items will again, start floating.
Putting materials in the inventory will make those items sink instead.
